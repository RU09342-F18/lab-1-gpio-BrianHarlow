# Brian Harlow's Off Board Blink

## Program Purpose
This Off Board Blink circuit was designed and programmed to blink two LEDs at differing rates on a breadboard as opposed to on the actual development board.

## Functionality
This program shares the same functionality as the Multiple Blink for the MSP430G2553 microcontroller. The same code was used for both parts.

## Microcontrollers Used
Because the MSP430G2553 was the only microcontroller that could be removed from its development board, it was the only microcontroller used for this portion of the lab.

## Demonstration
Beware of the sound. The shout at the end is courtesy of a classmate. *facepalm*
